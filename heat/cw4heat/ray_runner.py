"""
A Ray backend for HeAT controller-worker wrapper.

1. Init() nitializes actors
   - one for each node in the existing ray cluster
   - actors connect through MPI
2. Start actors
   - actors will sit in recv-loop and wait for work
3. fini() kills all actors.
   - Make sure you let distributor end recv-loop before calling this.
