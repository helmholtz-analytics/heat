    """
    Generic wrapper for element-wise binary operations of two operands (either can be tensor or scalar).
    Takes the operation function and the two operands involved in the operation as arguments.

    Parameters
    ----------
    operation : function
        The operation to be performed. Function that performs operation elements-wise on the involved tensors,
        e.g. add values from other to self
    t1: DNDarray or scalar
        The first operand involved in the operation.
    t2: DNDarray or scalar
        The second operand involved in the operation.
    out: DNDarray, optional
        Output buffer in which the result is placed. If not provided, a freshly allocated array is returned.
    where: DNDarray, optional
        Condition to broadcast over the inputs. At locations where the condition is True, the `out` array
        will be set to the result of the operation. Elsewhere, the `out` array will retain its original
        value. If an uninitialized `out` array is created via the default `out=None`, locations within
        it where the condition is False will remain uninitialized. If distributed, the split axis (after
        broadcasting if required) must match that of the `out` array.
    fn_kwargs: Dict, optional
        keyword arguments used for the given operation
        Default: {} (empty dictionary)

    Returns
    -------
    result: ht.DNDarray
        A DNDarray containing the results of element-wise operation.

    Warning
    -------
    If both operands are distributed, they must be distributed along the same dimension, i.e. `t1.split = t2.split`.

    MPI communication is necessary when both operands are distributed along the same dimension, but the distribution maps do not match. E.g.:
    ```
    a =  ht.ones(10000, split=0)
    b = ht.zeros(10000, split=0)
    c = a[:-1] + b[1:]
    ```
    In such cases, one of the operands is redistributed OUT-OF-PLACE to match the distribution map of the other operand.
    The operand determining the resulting distribution is chosen as follows:
    1) split is preferred to no split
    2) no (shape)-broadcasting in the split dimension if not necessary
    3) t1 is preferred to t2
