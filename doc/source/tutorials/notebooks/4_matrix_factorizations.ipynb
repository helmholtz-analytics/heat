    "Using PyTorch as compute engine and mpi4py for communication, Heat implements a number of array operations and algorithms that are optimized for memory-distributed data volumes. This allows you to tackle datasets that are too large for single-node (or worse, single-GPU) processing. \n",
    "\n",
    "As opposed to task-parallel frameworks, Heat takes a data-parallel approach, meaning that each \"worker\" or MPI process performs the same tasks on different slices of the data. Many operations and algorithms are not embarassingly parallel, and involve data exchange between processes. Heat operations and algorithms are designed to minimize this communication overhead, and to make it transparent to the user.\n",
