        "# Anomaly Detection with the Local Outlier Factor\n",
        "\n",
        "The **Local Outlier Factor (LOF)** is a density-based anomaly detection algorithm that quantifies how isolated each data point is relative to its local neighborhood.\n",
        "Instead of applying a single global distance threshold, LOF estimates the **local density** around every sample and compares it with the densities of its nearest neighbors.\n",
        "Points located in regions that are substantially less dense than those of their neighbors are considered potential outliers.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "This localized approach makes LOF particularly effective for datasets with **non-uniform density**, where clusters vary in compactness or spread.\n",
        "The algorithm produces a **LOF score** for each sample, which can be interpreted as follows:\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "- **LOF < 1:** The sample lies in a denser region than its neighbors (potentially part of a very compact cluster).\n",
        "- **LOF ≈ 1:** The sample has a density comparable to its neighbors and is considered *normal*.\n",
        "- **LOF >> 1:** The sample resides in a region of much lower density and is likely an *outlier*.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "In this way, LOF captures *relative density deviations* rather than assuming a single global notion of normality, enabling robust detection of local anomalies in complex datasets.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "This notebook shows how to:\n",
        "1. Generate a small synthetic dataset with normal points and outliers.\n",
        "2. Apply Heat’s distributed LOF implementation.\n",
        "3. Visualize and interpret the resulting anomaly scores."
