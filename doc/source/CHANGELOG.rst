   Dependencies: constrain ``torchvision`` version range to match

.. _highlights-2:

Highlights
----------

-  Slicing/indexing overhaul for a more NumPy-like user experience.
   Warning for distributed arrays: `breaking
   change! <#breaking-changes>`__ Indexing one element along the
   distribution axis now implies the indexed element is communicated to
   all processes.
-  More flexibility in handling non-load-balanced distributed arrays.
-  More distributed operations,
   incl.¬†`meshgrid <https://github.com/helmholtz-analytics/heat/pull/794>`__.

Breaking Changes
----------------

-  `#758 <https://github.com/helmholtz-analytics/heat/pull/758>`__
   Indexing a distributed ``DNDarray`` along the ``DNDarray.split``
   dimension now returns a non-distributed ``DNDarray``, i.e.¬†the
   indexed element is MPI-broadcasted. Example on 2 processes:

   .. code:: python

      a = ht.arange(5 * 5, split=0).reshape((5, 5))
      print(a.larray)
      >>> [0] tensor([[ 0,  1,  2,  3,  4],
      >>> [0]         [ 5,  6,  7,  8,  9],
      >>> [0]         [10, 11, 12, 13, 14]], dtype=torch.int32)
      >>> [1] tensor([[15, 16, 17, 18, 19],
      >>> [1]         [20, 21, 22, 23, 24]], dtype=torch.int32)
      b = a[:, 2]
      print(b.larray)
      >>> [0] tensor([ 2,  7, 12], dtype=torch.int32)
      >>> [1] tensor([17, 22], dtype=torch.int32)
      print(b.shape)
      >>> [0] (5,)
      >>> [1] (5,)
      print(b.split)
      >>> [0] 0
      >>> [1] 0
      c = a[4]
      print(c.larray)
      >>> [0] tensor([20, 21, 22, 23, 24], dtype=torch.int32)
      >>> [1] tensor([20, 21, 22, 23, 24], dtype=torch.int32)
      print(c.shape)
      >>> [0] (5,)
      >>> [1] (5,)
      print(c.split)
      >>> [0] None
      >>> [1] None

   memory leak in ``DNDarray.larray``

   ``randn`` values are pushed away from 0 by the minimum value the

v0.2.1
======

This version fixes the packaging, such that installed versions of HeAT
contain all required Python packages.

v0.2.0
======

This version varies greatly from the previous version (0.1.0). This
version includes a great increase in functionality and there are many
changes. Many functions which were working previously now behave more
closely to their numpy counterparts. Although a large amount of progress
has been made, work is still ongoing. We appreciate everyone who uses
this package and we work hard to solve the issues which you report to
us. Thank you!

Updated Package Requirements
----------------------------

-  python >= 3.5

Additions
---------

GPU Support
~~~~~~~~~~~

`#415 <https://github.com/helmholtz-analytics/heat/pull/415>`__ GPU
support was added for this release. To set the default device use
``ht.use_device(dev)`` where ``dev`` can be either ‚Äúgpu‚Äù or ‚Äúcpu‚Äù. Make
sure to specify the device when creating DNDarrays if the desired device
is different than the default. If no device is specified then that
device is assumed to be ‚Äúcpu‚Äù.

Bug Fixes
=========

-  KMeans bug fixes

   -  Working in distributed mode
   -  Fixed shape cluster centers for ``init='kmeans++'``

-  \__local_op now returns proper gshape
-  allgatherv fix -> elements now sorted in the correct order
-  getitiem fixes and improvements
-  unique now returns a distributed result if the input was distributed
-  AllToAll on single process now functioning properly
-  optional packages are truly optional for running the unit tests
-  the output of mean and var (and std) now set the correct split axis
   for the returned DNDarray
