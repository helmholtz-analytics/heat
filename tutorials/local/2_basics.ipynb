    "### Distributed Computing\n",
    "\n",
    "Heat is also able to make use of distributed processing capabilities such as those in high-performance cluster systems. For this, Heat exploits the fact that the operations performed on a multi-dimensional array are usually identical for all data items. Hence, a data-parallel processing strategy can be chosen, where the total number of data items is equally divided among all processing nodes. An operation is then performed individually on the local data chunks and, if necessary, communicates partial results behind the scenes. A Heat array assumes the role of a virtual overlay of the local chunks and realizes and coordinates the computations - see the figure below for a visual representation of this concept.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://github.com/helmholtz-analytics/heat/blob/main/doc/images/split_array.png?raw=true\" width=\"100%\"></img>\n",
    "\n",
    "The chunks are always split along a singular dimension (i.e. 1-D domain decomposition) of the array. You can specify this in Heat by using the `split` paramter. This parameter is present in all relevant functions, such as array creation (`zeros(), ones(), ...`) or I/O (`load()`) functions. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples are provided below. The result of an operation on a Heat tensor will in most cases preserve the split of the respective operands. However, in some cases the split axis might change. For example, a transpose of a Heat array will equally transpose the split axis. Furthermore, a reduction operations, e.g. `sum()` that is performed across the split axis, might remove data partitions entirely. The respective function behaviors can be found in Heat's documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may also modify the data partitioning of a Heat array by using the `resplit()` function. This allows you to repartition the data as you so choose. Please note, that this should be used sparingly and for small data amounts only, as it entails significant data copying across the network. Finally, a Heat array without any split, i.e. `split=None` (default), will result in redundant copies of data on each computation node.\n",
    "\n",
    "On a technical level, Heat follows the so-called [Bulk Synchronous Parallel (BSP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulk_synchronous_parallel) processing model. For the network communication, Heat utilizes the [Message Passing Interface (MPI)](https://computing.llnl.gov/tutorials/mpi/), a *de facto* standard on modern high-performance computing systems. It is also possible to use MPI on your laptop or desktop computer. Respective software packages are available for all major operating systems.
