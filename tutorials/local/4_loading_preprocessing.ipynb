    "Using PyTorch as compute engine and mpi4py for communication, Heat implements a number of array operations and algorithms that are optimized for memory-distributed data volumes. This allows you to tackle datasets that are too large for single-node (or worse, single-GPU) processing. \n",
    "\n",
    "As opposed to task-parallel frameworks, Heat takes a data-parallel approach, meaning that each \"worker\" or MPI process performs the same tasks on different slices of the data. Many operations and algorithms are not embarassingly parallel, and involve data exchange between processes. Heat operations and algorithms are designed to minimize this communication overhead, and to make it transparent to the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words: \n",
    "- you don't have to worry about optimizing data chunk sizes; \n",
    "- you don't have to make sure your research problem is embarassingly parallel, or artificially make your dataset smaller so your RAM is sufficient; \n",
    "- you do have to make sure that you have sufficient **overall** RAM to run your global task (e.g. number of nodes / GPUs)."
