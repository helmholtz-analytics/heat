# v0.2.1

This version fixes the packaging, such that installed versions of HeAT contain all required Python packages.

# v0.2.0

This version varies greatly from the previous version (0.1.0). This version includes a great increase in
functionality and there are many changes. Many functions which were working previously now behave more closely
to their numpy counterparts. Although a large amount of progress has been made, work is still ongoing. We
appreciate everyone who uses this package and we work hard to solve the issues which you report to us. Thank you!

## Updated Package Requirements
- python >= 3.5
- mpi4py >= 3.0.0
- numpy >= 1.13.0
- torch >= 1.3.0

#### Optional Packages
- h5py >= 2.8.0
- netCDF4 >= 1.4.0, <= 1.5.2
- pre-commit >= 1.18.3 (development requirement)

## Additions

### GPU Support
[#415](https://github.com/helmholtz-analytics/heat/pull/415) GPU support was added for this release. To set the default device use `ht.use_device(dev)` where `dev` can be either
"gpu" or "cpu". Make sure to specify the device when creating DNDarrays if the desired device is different than the
default. If no device is specified then that device is assumed to be "cpu".
